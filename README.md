🚀 termux-vkrm
A custom-built fork of Termux — rebuilt, rebranded, and reimagined.
🧠 What is termux-vkrm?
termux-vkrm is my custom fork of Termux, built from the ground up by compiling and integrating 2200+ Termux libraries, with the sole intention of creating something different, personal, and expandable.
This project is not just a rebrand — it’s a technical experiment, a learning journey, and the foundation for a future ecosystem.
📦 Package Details
Original package: com.termux
Custom package: com.vkrm
Fork base: Termux
Libraries compiled: 2200+
Platform: Android
The package name was intentionally changed — partly technical, partly personal, and yes… partly to satisfy my ego 😄
Sometimes that’s how real projects begin.
🕒 Project Timeline
April – June
Initial development phase
Heavy experimentation, builds, failures, and learning
Break period
Stepped away to reset and rethink the direction

Returned with clearer goals
Refined, rebuilt, and finalized the custom fork
🎯 Why this project exists
To understand Termux at a deep architectural level
To prove I can build and maintain a large-scale fork
To experiment beyond limitations of the original package
To lay the groundwork for something bigger than just a fork
This project exists because curiosity > convenience.
🌱 Vision
This repository is not the end goal.
It is the base layer.
The long-term plan is to grow this into a custom Termux-based ecosystem, where components, tools, and ideas can evolve independently while staying connected.
🔮 Future Plans
Hidden.
Not abandoned.
Not undecided.
Just not public — yet.

⭐ Closing Note
This repository represents:
persistence
curiosity
and the courage to build something just because I wanted to
